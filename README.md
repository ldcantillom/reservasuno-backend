# REST API for Airline System ✈️
This is my first project developed with Spring Boot. It is a REST API designed to manage basic operations related to an airline system. The main focus was to understand Spring Boot architecture and backend development principles, so currently it lacks certain essential validations.

## Key features 🌟
- Flight management: CRUD operations for managing available flights.
- User management: Basic functions for adding and listing users.
- Modular structure: Initial implementation of controllers, services and repositories to manage logic.

## Purpose 📚
This project was created as an educational exercise to:
- Familiarize myself with Spring Boot architecture.
- Implement REST endpoints following good initial practices.
- Integrate databases into the backend for data persistence.

## Project Status 🚧
Given its learning purpose, the API is still under development and could be extended with more functionalities and validations in future releases.

## Technologies used 🛠️
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL database
- Maven
- Mapstruct
- Lombok
